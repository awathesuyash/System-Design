Learning System Design

1.**Understanding Requirements:**
Start by understanding the requirements thoroughly. This involves clarifying the problem statement, identifying key functionalities, and understanding the expected scale and constraints.

2.**Scalability:**
Learn about horizontal and vertical scaling.
Understand techniques for scaling databases, caching systems, load balancers, etc.
Explore concepts like sharding, partitioning, replication, and consistent hashing.

3.**Performance:**
Study techniques to improve system performance, such as caching (both in-memory and distributed caching), optimizing database queries, and reducing latency.
Learn about content delivery networks (CDNs) and how they improve performance by caching content closer to users.

4.**Reliability:**
Delve into concepts like fault tolerance, redundancy, and disaster recovery.
Understand how to design systems resilient to failures at different levels (hardware, software, network).
Study distributed consensus algorithms like Paxos and Raft.

5.**Consistency:**
Learn about the CAP theorem and its implications on distributed systems.
Understand the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
Study different consistency models like eventual consistency, strong consistency, and causal consistency.

6.**Data Storage:**
Learn about various types of databases (SQL, NoSQL, NewSQL) and their use cases.
Understand data modeling techniques suitable for different types of databases.
Explore distributed storage systems like Amazon S3, Hadoop HDFS, and Google Cloud Storage.

7.**System Architecture:**
Understand different architectural patterns like monolithic, microservices, serverless, and event-driven architectures.
Learn about API design principles and best practices.
Study how to design systems for modifiability, extensibility, and maintainability.

8.**Networking:**
Understand networking fundamentals like TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS.
Learn about content-based routing, reverse proxies, and load balancing algorithms.
Study techniques for reducing network latency and improving throughput.

9.**Security:**
Learn about common security threats and vulnerabilities in distributed systems.
Understand techniques for authentication, authorization, and encryption.
Explore best practices for securing APIs, databases, and communication channels.

10.**Design Trade-offs:**
Learn how to make trade-offs between different design choices considering factors like cost, complexity, performance, and scalability.
Practice evaluating design alternatives and justifying your decisions.

11.**Real-world Case Studies:**
Study real-world system designs of popular platforms like Google Search, Facebook, Netflix, etc.
Understand the design principles and scalability techniques employed by these systems.

12.**Practice:**
Practice solving system design problems.
